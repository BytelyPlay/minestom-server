Hey! This is supposed to end up being a recreation of the Minecraft server I used to have called "Minigamz" it is now offline but i still own the domain minigamz.net at the time of writing. \n
At the time of writing it is still in development but is almost ready to get close to the real server... \n
My old server had a custom plugin but isn't really that custom... \n
This one is very custom... \n
This one also uses Bridagier since they made it a library and made it open sourced, it's also fitting as it is used for minecraft and this is also minecraft! \n
