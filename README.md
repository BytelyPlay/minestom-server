Hey! This is supposed to end up being a recreation of the Minecraft server I used to have called "Minigamz" it is now offline but I still own the domain minigamz.net at the time of writing. \
At the time of writing it is still in development but is almost ready to get close to the real server... \
My old server had a custom plugin but isn't really that custom... \
This one is very custom...\
This one also uses Bridagier since they made it a library and made it open sourced, it's also fitting as it is used for minecraft and this is also minecraft!
